Data Wrangling Recipes
=======================

**Welcome**

This book is a collection of code recipes for wrangling data.
At present, most of the code is in [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [Datatable](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/));
 with time, I may add code snippets in other languages.

It is also a means of documenting what I've learnt; hopefully as time goes by, it will get updated with newer and simpler ways to wrangle and automate data.
